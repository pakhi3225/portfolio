    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Pakhi — an engineering student driven by curiosity, creativity, and a strong desire to make a meaningful impact through technology. I am currently building my skills in programming, with a focus on Python and C, as I lay the groundwork for advanced studies and a career in tech-driven problem-solving.

      My academic journey is complemented by real-world experiences, including an insightful educational tour to Japan, which sparked my ambition to pursue a master’s degree there. I am inspired by Japan’s innovation, efficiency, and deep-rooted respect for tradition and progress — qualities I hope to embody in both my academic and personal growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the classroom, I’m an avid reader, an animal lover, and someone who enjoys exploring cultures, food, and ideas. I believe that being a great engineer means being a lifelong learner — and that’s exactly the path I’m on.
